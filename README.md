# Sudoku Solver Visualization

**Sudoku** is a logic-based number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. (From *Wikipedia*)

This **React app** generates a randomized solvable board and allows you to play this classic game puzzle. In addition, you may use the "solve" button, which will animate the backtracking solution of the current randomized board. 

Currently, a simple backtracking algorithm is used.

Check out the running app (Please use *Google Chrome*): https://venturk.github.io/Sudoku-Solver-Visualization/
